# Free-Localization-Strings-Database
Database of localized strings from native speakers that every developer can use for its commercial (or personal) projects.

##Why?

Today is not enought to just make an app, you have to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/internationalization/">localize it to distribute well</a>. And this is very big problem for every small indie software makers. We have to use paid services to do that simple job. But we all around the Globe and we all native speakers for some language.

##How?

We can't localize every string from every app, of course, but we can translate standard strings, like File, Edit, View, Window, Help, etc. And in the next time when you one, you can count on our database, take it and use it. For free and make most of your apps strings ready to speak on your customers language.
